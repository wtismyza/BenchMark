/**
 * The starting point for accessing FoundationDB.
 *  <br>
 *  <h2>Setting API version</h2>
 *  The FoundationDB API is accessed with a call to {@link #selectAPIVersion(int)}.
 *   This call is required before using any other part of the API. The call allows
 *   an error to be thrown at this point to prevent client code from accessing a later library
 *   with incorrect assumptions from the current version. The API version documented here is version
 *   {@code 630}.<br><br>
 *  FoundationDB encapsulates multiple versions of its interface by requiring
 *   the client to explicitly specify the version of the API it uses. The purpose
 *   of this design is to allow you to upgrade the server, client libraries, or
 *   bindings without having to modify client code. The client libraries support
 *   all previous versions of the API. The API version specified by the client is
 *   used to control the behavior of the binding. You can therefore upgrade to
 *   more recent packages (and thus receive various improvements) without having
 *   to change your code.<br><br>
 *  Warning: When using the multi-version client API, setting an API version that
 *   is not supported by a particular client library will prevent that client from 
 *   being used to connect to the cluster. In particular, you should not advance
 *   the API version of your application after upgrading your client until the 
 *   cluster has also been upgraded.<br>
 *  <h2>Getting a database</h2>
 *  Once the API version has been set, the easiest way to get a {@link Database} object to use is
 *   to call {@link #open}.
 *  <br>
 *  <h2>Client networking</h2>
 *  The network is started either implicitly with a call to a variant of {@link #open()}
 *  or started explicitly with a call to {@link #startNetwork()}.
 *  <br>
 *
