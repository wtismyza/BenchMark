IFailureMonitor is used by load balancing, data distribution and other components
to report on which other machines are unresponsive or experiencing other failures.
This is vital both to reconfigure the system in response to failures and to prevent
actors from waiting forever for replies from remote machines that are no longer
available.  When waiting for a reply, clients should generally stop waiting and
try an alternative server when a failure is reported, rather than relying on timeouts.

The information tracked for each machine is a FailureStatus, which
for the moment is just a boolean but might be richer in the future.

Get an IFailureMonitor by calling g_network->failureMonitor(); the simulator keeps
one for each simulated machine and ASIONetwork keeps one for each process.

The system attempts to ensure that failures are reported quickly, but may occasionally
report a working system as failed temporarily.  Clients that intend to take very costly
actions as a result of a failure should probably wait a while to see if a machine becomes
unfailed first.  If possible use onFailedFor() which in the future may react to 'permanent'
failures immediately.

In older FDB, information reported through this interface was actually actively supplied by
failureMonitorClient, which exchanges FailureMonitoringRequest/Reply pairs with the
failureDetectionServer actor on the ClusterController.

Now it is done locally by each process with help of of FlowTransport. Whenever a network
connection is establish/failed, the address is marked as available or failed accordingly. We
do however take an optimistic approach of assuming every newly discovered address
(when deserializing an endpoint) is healthy by default.

In the future it may be augmented with locally available information about failures (e.g.
TCP connection loss in ASIONetwork or unexpectedly long response times for application requests).

Communications failures are tracked at NetworkAddress granularity.  When a request is made to
a missing endpoint on a non-failed machine, this information is reported back to the requesting
machine and tracked at the endpoint level.
