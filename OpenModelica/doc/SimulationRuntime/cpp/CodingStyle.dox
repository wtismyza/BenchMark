  There are some rules that should be considered if a contribution to the runtime is made.

  - use 2 spaces instead of tabs
  - all function-names should start with a lower letter and multiple words should be combined in camel case (e.g. getName)
  - member variables start with an underscore, multiple words are combined in camel case as well (e.g. _isActive)
  - use the Doxygen JavaDoc/C - notation to document your code (this notation starts with a slash followed by 2 stars)
