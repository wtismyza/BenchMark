# In this file the tests are formulated which
# should run in the docker container to test
# whether the RPM and DEB packages work properly.
#
# In order to add a test, a user first has to
# add the name of the test to the `tests` array
# which is defined in this file.
#
# Then, she must define the state this test
# expects the container to be in. To do that,
# a value for the test has to be added to the
# associative array `test_start_state`. Valid
# values are:
#
#  - INSTALLED: In this case, the test will be
#    started with a freshly installed FDB, but
#    no other changes were made to the container.
#  - CLEAN: This simply means that the container
#    will run a minimal version of the OS (as defined
#    in the corresponsing Dockerfile)
#
# A test is then simply a bash function with the
# same name as the test. It can use the predefined
# bash functions `install` and `uninstall` to either
# install or uninstall FDB on the container. The FDB
# build directory can be found in `/build`, the
# source code will be located in `/foundationdb`
