Using cluster file `/home/fdb/buildbot/network/mmikhail/foundation/fdb_windows.cluster.txt'.

Cluster file is not up to date.

It contains the connection string:
local:JC3yLTxBro2bWVFjstWIVc6Ou67ZY8Qx@127.0.0.1:4701,127.0.0.1:4703,127.0.0.1:4
704

The original connection string is:
local:cmYEATJrtGOP985SAXQ04kmGJxxguHVj@127.0.0.1:4701,127.0.0.1:4703

This must mean that file permissions or other platform issues have prevented
the file from being updated. To change coordinators without manual intervention,
the cluster file and its containing folder must be writable by all servers and
clients. If a majority of the coordinators referenced by the old connection
string are lost, the database will stop working until the correct cluster file
is distributed to all processes.
