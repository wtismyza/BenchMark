// ThreadSafeQueue<T> is a multi-producer, single-consumer queue.  

// It is almost but not quite lock-free (the exception is that if a thread is 
// stopped in a very narrow window in push(), pop() will "block" in the sense
// of returning Optional<T>() to the consumer until the former thread makes progress)

// It has an extra facility for event-loop integration: calling canSleep() before blocking
// the consumer thread and waking the consumer thread whenever push() returns true will permit
// the consumer thread to block when the queue is empty with a minimum of overhead.  A caller
// can ignore this facility by simply not calling canSleep and ignoring the return value of push().

// Based in part on the queue at http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/intrusive-mpsc-node-based-queue
