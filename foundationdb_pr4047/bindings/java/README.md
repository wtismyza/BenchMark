FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers. It organizes data as an ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations. It is especially well-suited for read/write workloads but also has excellent performance for write-intensive workloads. Users interact with the database using API language binding.

## FoundationDB Java Bindings

In order to build the java bindings,
[JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) >= 8
has to be installed. CMake will try to find a JDK installation, if it can find
one it will automatically build the java bindings.

If you have Java installed but cmake fails to find them, set the
`JAVA_HOME`environment variable.

### Fat Jar

By default, the generated jar file will depend on an installed libfdb_java
(provided with the generated RPM/DEB file on Linux). However, users usually find
a Jar-file that contains this library more convenient. This is also what you
will get if you download the jar file from Maven.

This file can be generated by compiling the `packages` target. For example with
make, you can run:

``` shell
make packages
```

#### Multi-Platform Jar-File

If you want to create a jar file that can run on more than one supported
architecture (the offical one supports MacOS, Linux, and Windows), you can do
that by executing the following steps:

1. Create a directory called `lib` somewhere on your file system.
1. Create a subdirectory for each *additional* platform you want to support
   (`windows` for windows, `osx` for MacOS, and `linux` for Linux).
1. Under each of those create a subdirectory with the name of the architecture
   (currently only `amd64` is supported - on MacOS this has to be called
   `x86_64` - `amd64` on all others).
1. Set the cmake variable `FAT_JAR_BINARIES` to this `lib` directory. For
   example, if you created this directory structure under `/foo/bar`, the
   corresponding cmake command would be:

```
cmake -DFAT_JAR_BINARIES=/foo/bar/lib <PATH_TO_FDB_SOURCE>
```

After executing building the packages (with `make packages` or the packages
target in  `Visual Studio`) you will find a jar-file in the `packages`
directory in your build directory.
