/**
 * Back-end for a @ref stream. A writer is responsible for retrieving packets
 * and transmitting them, and calling the user-provided handlers when heaps are
 * completed.
 *
 * Each stream class will need to implement a subclass of @ref writer. At a
 * minimum, it will need to implement @ref wakeup and @ref get_num_substreams.
 *
 * A writer is intended to run on an io_service. It is *not* thread-safe, so
 * the subclass must ensure that only one handler runs at a time.
 *
 * The @ref wakeup handler should use @ref get_packet to try to retrieve
 * packet(s) and send them, and should ensure that @ref groups_completed is
 * called after transmitting final packets of groups. It is also responsible
 * for updating queue_item::bytes_sent and
 * queue_item::result. Depending on the last result of @ref
 * get_packet, it should arrange for itself to be rerun by calling either
 * @ref sleep, @ref request_wakeup or @ref post_wakeup.
 *
 * It is not safe to call @ref wakeup (or @ref post_wakeup) immediately after
 * construction, because the associated stream is not yet known. If there is
 * initialisation that has the potential to interact with the stream
 * (including by posting a callback, which the io_service might immediately run
 * on another thread), it should be done by overriding @ref start.
