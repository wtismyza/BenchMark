* Version ?? (??)

  - Complex numbers, inf and nan are not allowed anymore as valid numbers when
    building JSON.
    (Fixes #32)


* Version 3.1.0 (Dec 31, 2018)

  - scm->json and scm->json-string now support an additional key argument
    #:unicode. If #:unicode is set to true unicode characters will be escaped
    when needed, otherwise characters won't be escaped (which now becomes the
    default).


* Version 3.0.0 (Dec 29, 2018)

  - This is another breaking change release.

  - JSON objects are now defined as alists (instead of hash tables) and JSON
    arrays are now defined as vectors (instead of lists). Both of these
    changes are mainly to use types that have read syntax. This will simplify
    things for the user when defining JSON objects which is probably the most
    common case.

  - Fixed and issue when parsing only JSON numbers.

  - Added unit tests.


* Version 2.0.0 (Dec 12, 2018)

  - This is a breaking change release. It is not possible anymore to specify a
    JSON object using alists. Instead alist->hash-table needs to be explicitly
    used. This makes the bidirectional mapping between Guile hash-tables and
    JSON objects consistent.


* Version 1.3.2 (Dec 2, 2018)

  - Don't use GUILE_SITE and GUILE_SITE_CCACHE, build them as before. Print a
    helper message at the end of configure output to help users to install in
    Guile system's directory.


* Version 1.3.1 (Dec 1, 2018)

  - Fix guile.m4 to allow multiple candidates for guild, guile-config and
    guile-tools.

  - Use GUILE_SITE as the variable instead of GUILE_SITE_DIR.
    (Fixes #20)


* Version 1.3.0 (Nov 28, 2018)

  - Properly use guile.m4 macros to install to the right paths.
   (thanks to Jason Douglas Earl)


* Version 1.2.0 (Aug 22, 2018)

  - Switch to GPLv3.


* Version 1.1.1 (Aug 14, 2018)

  - Don't output extra spaces except with pretty printing.


* Version 1.1.0 (Jul 26, 2018)

  - Install .go files to $(libdir)/guile.
    (thanks to Ludovic CourtÃ¨s)


* Version 1.0.1 (May 24, 2018)

  - Fixes an issue while handling alists with #nil at the beginning.


* Version 1.0.0 (May 23, 2018)

  - Support 4-byte unicode characters.
    (thanks to Christopher Lam)

  - Remove deprecated `json` macro.

  - Dual GPLv3 and LGPLv3 license.


* Version 0.6.0 (Jan 16, 2017)

  - Deprecate json macro in favor of scheme data types.


* Version 0.5.0 (Feb 21, 2015)

  - Allow converting simple alists to json
      e.g.: (scm->json-string '((a . 1) (b . 2))))
    (thanks to Jan Nieuwenhuizen)


* Version 0.4.0 (Aug 17, 2014)

  - Add unquote-splicing support to json form.
    (thanks to David Thompson)


* Version 0.3.1 (Jul 6, 2013)

  - Use pure sh script syntax in env.in.
    (thanks to Andrew Gaylard)


* Version 0.3.0 (May 13, 2013)

  - Re-licensed under LGPLv3.

  - Use new guile.m4 macro.

  - Convert rationals to floats to comply with JSON spec.
    (closes github #3, patch from Doug Woos)


* Version 0.2.0 (Apr 2, 2013)

  - Improve parser errors by providing an additional parser argument to
    the json-invalid exception.


* Version 0.1.3 (Feb 10, 2013)

  - Automatically update pkg-list.scm version.


* Version 0.1.2 (Feb 7, 2013)

  - Fix pretty printing.

  - Use (display) instead of (simple-format) when possible.


* Version 0.1.1 (Feb 2, 2013)

  - Use (car)/(cdr) instead of (drop-right)/(last). This should be more
    efficient.


* Version 0.1.0 (Jan 30, 2013)

  Initial release.
